# IS-733-Week2-Datamining
## Project Overview  

This project focuses on **data profiling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using **Python and Pandas**. The primary goal is to analyze datasets such as **breast cancer data and data science salaries**, understanding their structure, attributes, and key statistics.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:
- **Loaded multiple datasets** (e.g., `breast_cancer.csv`, `ds_salaries.csv`) for analysis.
- **Generated data profiles**:
  - Identified **data types** of each column.
  - Counted **unique values** per attribute.
  - Extracted **minimum and maximum values** for numerical attributes.
- **Dataset Shape & Attribute Analysis**:
  - Determined the **total number of attributes**.
  - Classified attributes into **numerical and discrete categories**.
- **Exploratory Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed invalid/missing values.
  - Analyzed distributions of key attributes.

This analysis helps in **understanding the dataset structure, identifying key variables, and preparing the data for further processing or machine learning models**.
